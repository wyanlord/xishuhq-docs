# Getting Started

KetaOps is a cloud service platform designed to build full-link observability for every application in the era of cloud computing and cloud-native systems.

1. [Install Agent](?activeTab=start_agent): This is the most crucial step in using the KetaOps platform. Only after installing the Agent can we collect, parse, and send data on the platform. KetaAgent supports a wide range of platforms, including Linux, Windows, MacOS, and more. It also supports deployment on containerized platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes. Manual deployment is supported, as well as batch deployment using configuration management tools like Ansible. In this section, weâ€™ll walk through the simplest single-machine deployment to set up the first Agent.

2. [Data Integration](?activeTab=start_collect): The platform's application marketplace supports a wide range of out-of-the-box data integration applications. Data integration supports both local collection based on Agent and remote collection based on Consumer, as well as server-side listening collection capabilities. Mastering the use of data integration functions makes data integration more convenient and standardized, significantly reducing the difficulty and cost of data collection. We will guide you through selecting a data integration application to learn from.

3. [Data Exploration](?activeTab=start_explore): Once observability data, including metrics, traces, logs, and event data, has entered unified storage, we provide users with rich data exploration features. These include interactive search, metric exploration, and advanced SPL searches. Here, we will introduce simple scenarios for metrics and logs to help you explore the data.

4. [Visualization and Analysis](?activeTab=start_dashboard): The platform offers rich dashboard visualization features, providing teams and individuals with the basis for global diagnostics and action. Custom dashboards allow users to focus on the information that is most important and frequently used, consolidating it into a dashboard. We will guide you through how to quickly copy existing dashboards and add the data you care about to your dashboard.

5. [Alert Analysis](?activeTab=start_alert): With the alert notification feature, you can quickly detect, locate, and resolve issues. The platform supports alerting for multiple data types, including metrics, traces, and logs. Making full use of alerting capabilities can better ensure the health of your business.
