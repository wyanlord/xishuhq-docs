# Product Overview

## Product Positioning

The KetaOps platform, independently developed by Xishu Technology, is a product designed to provide flexible, comprehensive, and reliable observability services for development and operations teams working on cloud and cloud-native architectures. In contrast to the numerous open-source tools available in the market, Xishu's Keta platform primarily focuses on interpreting IT operations from a global operational perspective. It integrates multi-dimensional data such as alerts, performance metrics, and logs, and, with the support of AI-driven operations middleware, achieves intelligent scenarios such as precise alerts, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, system profiling, capacity analysis, and service level management. This enables metric systematization, event intelligence, and data-driven operational decision-making, helping enterprises reduce costs, improve efficiency, and optimize operational decisions.

We first have a unified underlying storage and system architecture, and we have thoroughly analyzed and integrated all mainstream cloud and cloud computing-related technology stacks in the market. Any team can easily use our product without needing to build dedicated teams for research or modify immature open-source products. Our professional product and service teams assist customers in building core data-driven security systems.
